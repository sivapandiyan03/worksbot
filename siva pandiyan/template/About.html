                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>I am currently pursuing my B-Tech Information Technology in Adhiyamaan College of Engineering. I am a consistent
                   performer not just in studies but also in many practical experiences, because of which I have consistently put on myself
                   to work and gain experiences through many such projects along with college’s curriculum. Some of which is listed in
                   my resume attached.
                   I sincerely hope my resume highlights and stands as a proof that I can add more value to your organization and more
                   industry ready than the typical average. I enjoy working with like-minded people and I am a great team player. It’ll be a
                   great honor for me to start my career with your organization and grow with it. I hope, I will get a chance to prove myself
                   over further interview process and eventually get to work with a great organization like yours.
                   I’m looking forward to positively hearing from you soon. Have a great day ahead.
                </p>
